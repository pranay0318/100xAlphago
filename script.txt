In a forest, a cocky rabbit challenged a slow turtle to a race. The rabbit sprinted ahead and, confident he'd win, napped near the finish line. Meanwhile, the turtle moved steadily, passing the sleeping rabbit. The rabbit woke too late; the turtle crossed the finish line first. Slow and steady wins the race.
